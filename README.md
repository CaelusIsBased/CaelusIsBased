<!--**CaelusIsBased/CaelusIsBased** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- Iâ€™m an Electrical Engineer! I work often in Statistical Signal Processing, but I also really love to work on anything that broadly falls under/is related to signal processing (this includes topics like Reinforcement Learning, for example). 
- In my free time, I sing. Tried the keys but no real progress </3. I play the violin sometimes tho. Picked up digital art recently. Perspectives and anatomy are hard T_T
