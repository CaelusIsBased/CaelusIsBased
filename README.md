<!--**CaelusIsBased/CaelusIsBased** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- Iâ€™m an Electrical Engineer! I work often in Statistical Signal Processing, but I also really love to work on anything that broadly falls under/is related to signal processing (this includes topics like Reinforcement Learning, for example). 
- Iâ€™m currently trying to get into digital VLSI, mainly related to chip design. If you got something cool to share, please do so!
- In my free time I do a lot of music! I'm a singer, and I listen to a variety of genres. I'm a metal head, and I also really enjoy Japanese music, if you got any cool songs, do share!
- Iâ€™m an artist, I draw a lot of things whenever I'm free! I picked it up relatively recently, and I'm still learning anatomy and angles and perspectives. I used to play gacha games and watch anime, so I naturally draw a lot of fanarts! I might add a website soon to showcase my collections :p
