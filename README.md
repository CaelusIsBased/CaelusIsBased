<!--**CaelusIsBased/CaelusIsBased** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- I’m an Electrical Engineer! I work often in Statistical Signal Processing, but I also really love to work on anything that broadly falls under/is related to signal processing (this includes topics like Reinforcement Learning, for example).
- Lately I've been doing a lot of RTL coding. I might upload the different modules I implemented, you can check them out!
- I'm familiar with the following:
  Programming languages: C, Python, MATLAB. HDL: SystemVerilog. Scripting: TCL.
- In my free time, I sing, and I play the violin sometimes. I'm learning digital art.
- Here's my website I made from one of Github's templates: loremipsum
